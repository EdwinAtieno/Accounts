# Bank account simulation



There are three types of transactions to simulate:
Deposit: Increment a given individual's account balance by a given amount
Withdrawal: Verify that the account holder has sufficient funds to make the withdrawal. If there are sufficient funds, decrease the account balance by the given number. If funds are not sufficient, make no change to the account balance.
Transfer: Verify that the account holder has sufficient funds to make the transfer. If there are sufficient funds, decrease the sender's account balance by the given number and increase the receiverâ€™s account balance by that same number. If funds are not sufficient, make no change to any account balances.


##Example transactions:
DEPOSIT: Wanjiru:150.00 (Deposit 150.00 into Wanjiru's account)
WITHDRAW: Juma:1648.26 (Withdraw 1648.26 from Juma's account)
TRANSFER: Wanjiru:Linda:500.00 (Transfer 500.00 from Wanjiru's account to Linda's account)
